# -Unit 2 Reflection-

### What did not worked well ?
I think I improved a lot in this unit but I feel that I still need to improve more my time management. I also really 
liked doing the arduino lessons, but we did not have time to finish all of them which was sad because I had fun doing it.

### What did you enjoyed the most during unit 2?
The project was amazing, my group worked well together and even though it was stressful I had fun doing it. 

### What talent have you discovered or practice during this unit?
Making pretty graphs

### What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
More time to do the quizzes during the class and finish the lessons.
