# -Unit 1 Reflection-

### What worked well during unit 1?


### What did not worked well ?

Time manegement. Sometimes I need more time to do my assignments in other subjects because of language barriers and because of 
that I did not manage my time really well to do all my assignments to this class. I am also not used to ask for help.So for the next unit I 
plan to organize my time better.

### What did you enjoyed the most during unit 1?

Doing the project, even though it was a very tiring project, it was very nice to do it, because I was able to explore new skills and challenge myself. 
And being able to see how the computer science works on a daily basis was amazing. I also had the opportunity to work together 
with some of my classmates and make new friends which was really cool.

### What talent have you discovered or practice during this unit?

Doing the design of the project with colors and emojis, it was really fun to do it.

### What is working well in Computer Science for you?

Having a lot of opportunities to practice. Even if sometimes it is a lot of work, for example with the quizzes, for me it is really important to practice.

### What can Dr Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?

More time to do the quizzes during the class.
